# Hotel Management System

## Overview

As a solo developer, inspired by the challenge of manual operations & liitations of our home-turned-mini-guest-house, I envisioned and built a hotel management app. HMS is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline hotel operations and enhance user experience. This system provides a robust platform for users to manage bookings, connect with hoteliers, handle payments, and oversee various aspects of hotel management efficiently. Built using Django, leverages modern web technologies to offer a seamless and intuitive interface for both hotel administrators and guests.

- **Room Booking:** Select and book rooms with ease, add optional services, and confirm reservations.
- **Session Management:** Utilizes sessions to carry user selections throughout the booking process, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Future Enhancements
While the current focus is on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with essential features, future updates may include:
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Guests will be able to share their feedback and help the hotels improve!
- **Notifications:** I will implement a realtime notification system to keep users informed about their bookings and updates.
- **Bookmarks:** Enable users to bookmark their favorite hotels for easy access.
- **Additional Payment Gateways:** I will integrate other payment options.
